Info:
These 2 scripts are written for Python 3.8, and will be compiled after adding a UI to open it up to more people

These scripts work on the assumption all of the images you want to stack are laid out in the format in the Imaging Guide,
and that Deep Sky Stacker or Siril are installed in the default install location on a Windows PC,
For the moment it is only stacking photos that score higher than 2.5 Arc Seconds FWHM, this is on line 18 and can be
changed as needed, I will be breaking this out in the UI soon
the SIRIL Script will need the library commented in the top of the script installed to use it.

I do not expect people to take dark-flats, Its included in there for flexibility for those that do.

Folder Name:
  Bias
  Darks
  DarkFlats
  Flats
  Lights
  info.txt
  
and that the info.txt file contains the following keywords with there values filled out
Currently only Focal Length, Barlow Magnification, Pixel Size and Arcsec / Pixel are used
if Arcsec / Pixel is not populated it will be calculated by the script using the other 3.

Instruction of use:
When you open the script it will ask for a folder, please select the folder containing all of the Bias/Dark etc folders
once selected,

It will go through and register, score and stack the images into a tile that has your combined image in
the top level folder, this process will take some time depending on how powerful your PC and the size of the data
